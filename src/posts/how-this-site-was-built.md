Time for a change!

## Tech stack

I thought this project would be a good opportunity for me to try out some new things.

### First version

React with Styled Components

### Second version

NextJS with CSS Modules

### Third version

Sveltekit

## And the winner is ... Sveltekit!

Having built the exact same project three times I was able to compare each approach,

```javascript
class Dog extends Pet
{
    public function __construct(
        public string $name,
        public bool $isGoodBoy,
        public bool $isHappy
    ) {};

    public function pat(): void
    {
        $this->isHappy = true;
    }
}
```
